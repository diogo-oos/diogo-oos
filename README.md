- 👋 Hi, I’m @diogo-oos
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a developer, i really like the IT area despite sometimes stressing me out a little bit haha. I'm starting to learn now. I accept tips! :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming logic and also learning about github and git. I am already at the end of the logic and I will try to learn a real programming language. I am thinking of Java Script, Python or C #. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me and others to grow as people and professionals. :)
